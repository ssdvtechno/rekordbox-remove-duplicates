# M3U8 Playlist Duplicate Remover

This Python script removes duplicate entries from an M3U8 playlist file by considering only the file names, ignoring the directory paths. This ensures that if a file with the same name exists in multiple folders, only one instance is kept in the cleaned playlist.

## Simple Guide: Running the M3U8 Playlist Duplicate Remover Script

### Step 1: Install Python

#### For Windows

1. **Install Python via Command Prompt:**
   - Open **Command Prompt**:
     - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
   - Download and install Python using the following commands:
     ```bash
     curl -o python-installer.exe https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.x.x/python-3.x.x-amd64.exe
     start python-installer.exe
     ```
   - During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**.
   - Follow the installation steps.

2. **Verify Python Installation:**
   - In **Command Prompt**, type the following command and press Enter:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - You should see the Python version number, confirming that Python is installed.

#### For macOS

1. **Install Python via Terminal:**
   - Open **Terminal**:
     - Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and hit Enter.
   - Install Homebrew if you haven't already:

     ```
   - Install Python using Homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install python
     ```

2. **Verify Python Installation:**
   - In **Terminal**, type the following command and press Enter:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```
   - You should see the Python version number, confirming that Python is installed.

### Step 2: Download the Script

#### For Windows

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:**
   - In **Command Prompt**, navigate to the directory where you want to save the script:
     ```bash
     cd C:\path\to\desired\folder
     ```
   - Clone the repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/m3u8-playlist-cleaner.git
     ```

#### For macOS

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:**
   - In **Terminal**, navigate to the directory where you want to save the script:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/desired/folder
     ```
   - Clone the repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/m3u8-playlist-cleaner.git
     ```

### Step 3: Exporting an M3U8 Playlist from Rekordbox

1. **Open Rekordbox:**
   - Launch Rekordbox on your computer.

2. **Select the Playlist:**
   - In the **Playlist** section on the left sidebar, right-click the playlist you want to export.

3. **Export as M3U8:**
   - Choose **Export Playlist** from the context menu and select **M3U8** as the export format.
   - Save the file as `playlist.m3u8` in the same directory where the script is located.

### Step 4: Run the Script

#### For Windows

1. **Navigate to the Script Location:**
   - In **Command Prompt**, navigate to the cloned repository:
     ```bash
     cd C:\path\to\desired\folder\m3u8-playlist-cleaner
     ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```bash
     python remove_m3u8_duplicates_by_filename.py
     ```

3. **Check the Output:**
   - The script will create a new file called `cleaned_playlist.m3u8` in the same folder.

#### For macOS

1. **Navigate to the Script Location:**
   - In **Terminal**, navigate to the cloned repository:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/desired/folder/m3u8-playlist-cleaner
     ```

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```bash
     python3 remove_m3u8_duplicates_by_filename.py
     ```

3. **Check the Output:**
   - The script will create a new file called `cleaned_playlist.m3u8` in the same folder.

### Step 5: Importing the Cleaned Playlist Back to Rekordbox

1. **Open Rekordbox:**
   - Launch Rekordbox on your computer.

2. **Import the Cleaned Playlist:**
   - In the **File** menu, choose **Import Playlist** and select the `cleaned_playlist.m3u8` file generated by the script.

3. **Check for Duplicates:**
   - The cleaned playlist will now appear in your Rekordbox library without duplicate entries.

### Troubleshooting

- **Command Not Found Error**: Ensure that Python is correctly installed and added to the system's PATH.
- **Script Not Working**: Make sure the script and playlist file are in the same directory and the filenames match those mentioned in the instructions.

### Conclusion

Following these steps, you should be able to remove duplicate entries from your M3U8 playlist easily and re-import it into Rekordbox. If you encounter any issues, please consult the Python documentation or seek help from a more experienced user.

## Features

- Removes duplicate entries based on the file name.
- Works with M3U8 playlist files.
- Outputs a cleaned M3U8 playlist file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/m3u8-playlist-cleaner.git

Navigate to the directory:

cd m3u8-playlist-cleaner
```


## Usage

1. Place your M3U8 playlist file in the same directory as the script and name it `playlist.m3u8`.

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python remove_m3u8_duplicates_by_filename.py
   ```

3. The script will create a new file called `cleaned_playlist.m3u8` in the same directory, containing the cleaned playlist without duplicate entries.

## Example

If your `playlist.m3u8` contains the following entries:

```
/music/folder1/song1.mp3
/music/folder2/song1.mp3
/music/folder1/song2.mp3
```

The `cleaned_playlist.m3u8` will contain:

```
/music/folder1/song1.mp3
/music/folder1/song2.mp3
```

## Script Details

The script works as follows:

- **Input File**: `playlist.m3u8` - The original playlist with potential duplicates.
- **Output File**: `cleaned_playlist.m3u8` - The cleaned playlist with duplicates removed.

## Acknowledgments

- This script was created to help manage large playlists by ensuring no duplicate entries exist, even if the files are located in different directories.
```

### Summary of Changes:
- **Rekordbox Export Section**: Moved before running the script so users know how to create the M3U8 file needed by the script.
- **Rekordbox Import Section**: Placed after running the script so users can import the cleaned playlist back into Rekordbox.

This structure should help guide users more intuitively through the process.
