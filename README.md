# M3U8 Playlist Duplicate Remover

This Python script removes duplicate entries from an M3U8 playlist file by considering only the file names, ignoring the directory paths. This ensures that if a file with the same name exists in multiple folders, only one instance is kept in the cleaned playlist.

## Simple Guide: Running the M3U8 Playlist Duplicate Remover Script

### Step 1: Install Python

#### For Windows

1. **Install Python via Command Prompt:**
   - Open **Command Prompt**:
     - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
   - Download and install Python using the following commands:

     ```bash
     curl -o python-installer.exe https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.x.x/python-3.x.x-amd64.exe
     start python-installer.exe
     ```

   - During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**.
   - Follow the installation steps.

2. **Verify Python Installation:**
   - In **Command Prompt**, type the following command and press Enter:

     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

   - You should see the Python version number, confirming that Python is installed.

#### For macOS

1. **Install Python via Terminal:**
   - Open **Terminal**.
   - Use the following command to install Python via Homebrew (if you don't have Homebrew installed, install it first with the following command):

     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```

   - Then install Python:

     ```bash
     brew install python
     ```

2. **Verify Python Installation:**
   - In **Terminal**, type the following command and press Enter:

     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```

   - You should see the Python version number, confirming that Python is installed.

### Step 2: Export M3U8 Playlist from Rekordbox

1. Open Rekordbox.
2. Right-click on a playlist and select **Export Playlist**.
3. Choose the format **M3U8** and save the file in the directory where the script is located.

### Step 3: Clone the Repository

#### For Windows

1. **Clone the repository using Command Prompt:**
   - Open **Command Prompt**.
   - Navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the repository:

     ```bash
     cd path\to\your\directory
     ```

   - Run the following command to clone the repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/m3u8-playlist-cleaner.git
     ```

   - Navigate to the cloned directory:

     ```bash
     cd m3u8-playlist-cleaner
     ```

#### For macOS

1. **Clone the repository using Terminal:**
   - Open **Terminal**.
   - Navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the repository:

     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/directory
     ```

   - Run the following command to clone the repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/m3u8-playlist-cleaner.git
     ```

   - Navigate to the cloned directory:

     ```bash
     cd m3u8-playlist-cleaner
     ```

### Step 4: Run the Script

1. **Ensure your M3U8 playlist file is named `playlist.m3u8` and is placed in the same directory as the script.**

2. **Run the script:**

   #### For Windows:

   ```bash
   python remove_m3u8_duplicates_by_filename.py
   ```

   #### For macOS:

   ```bash
   python3 remove_m3u8_duplicates_by_filename.py
   ```

3. **The script will create a new file called `cleaned_playlist.m3u8` in the same directory, containing the cleaned playlist without duplicate entries.**

### Step 5: Import the Cleaned Playlist Back to Rekordbox

1. Open Rekordbox.
2. Go to **File > Import Playlist**.
3. Select the `cleaned_playlist.m3u8` file generated by the script.
4. The cleaned playlist will be imported into Rekordbox.

## Example

If your `playlist.m3u8` contains the following entries:

```
/music/folder1/song1.mp3
/music/folder2/song1.mp3
/music/folder1/song2.mp3
```

The `cleaned_playlist.m3u8` will contain:

```
/music/folder1/song1.mp3
/music/folder1/song2.mp3
```

## Script Details

The script works as follows:

- **Input File**: `playlist.m3u8` - The original playlist with potential duplicates.
- **Output File**: `cleaned_playlist.m3u8` - The cleaned playlist with duplicates removed.
